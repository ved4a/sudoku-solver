# Sudoku Solver

## Why I Made This

A small project to help me keep in touch with C. It is also a practical application given that Sudoku is such a widely-played game, in all age groups. (To be honest, I'm mainly making this for my grandma.)

## How to Use it

You will need a working terminal for this, along with support for C/C++ on your IDE.
The variable "game" is an array with 9 rows and 9 columns. Each row is one array of 9 numbers, so each number can be manipulated row-wise in order to achieve create the Sudoku puzzle the player is attempting to solve. It is cumbersome, but when I am capable of finding an easier way to allow players to input this data, I will do so.

**Update:** I have managed to fix all the bugs, this took me way too long but its finished! I'll implement Java in the next version. Enjoy! ðŸ˜„
