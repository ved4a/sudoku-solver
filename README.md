# sudoku-solver

A small project to help me keep in touch with C. It is also a practical application given that Sudoku is such a widely-played game, in all age groups.

To be honest, I'm mainly making this for my grandma.

Update: I have managed to fix all the bugs, this took me way too long but its finished! I'll implement Java in the next version.
